## My process

- I followed the Scrimba Netflix clone course. I learned how to use compound components. I think it's very useful on large projects. I like very much the idea of using styled components. In the next project, I'll definitely use it on the next project. 

## What I learned

- Scalable folder structure
- How to make highly reusable components with Compound Component Pattern
- How to use styled-components
- Better undestanding of ReactJS
- Basic usage of Firebase authenticationand and firestore

1. Run the following commands from the terminal.

`git clone git@github.com:emirsagit/netflix-clone.git`

2. Create a firebase project. Change firebase settings to enable email login. Create database on Firestore. After that, go to the project folder and change Firebase API settings according to the firebase account on the src/index.js file. Uncomment `seedDatabase(fireStore);` line on src/index.js file.
